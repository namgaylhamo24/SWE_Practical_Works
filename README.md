## Practical 2: Text File Analyzer
**Excercise Question:**
* Modify the program to count the number of unique words in the text.
Add a function to find the longest word in the text.
Implement a feature to count the occurrences of a specific word (case-insensitive).
Create a function to calculate the percentage of words that are longer than the average word length.

## Practical 3:  Implementing Recursive and Iterative Fibonacci sequence generators
**Excercise Question:**
* Modify the iterative function to return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n, instead of just the nth number.
Implement a function that finds the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a given value.
Create a function that determines if a given number is a Fibonacci number.
Implement a function that calculates the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers and observe how it approaches the golden ratio.

* Discussion Questions
What are the advantages and disadvantages of the recursive approach compared to the iterative approach?
How does memoization improve the performance of the recursive function? Are there any drawbacks?
In what scenarios might you prefer to use a generator function over other implementations?
How does the space complexity differ between these implementations?
